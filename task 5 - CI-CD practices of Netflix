Netflix employs a microservices architecture. 
This architecture enables independent deployment and testing of services, aligning well with CI/CD principles.

Netflix utilizes Jenkins for CI. 
Developers push code changes frequently to a central repository, triggering automated builds and tests.

Netflix practices continuous deployment, where validated changes are automatically deployed to production.
Canary deployments are used to mitigate risks associated with deploying changes to production.

Netflix pioneered Chaos Engineering
It is a practice of intentionally introducing failures into systems to identify weaknesses and improve resilience. 
Chaos Monkey, one of Netflix's tools, randomly terminates production instances to simulate failures and ensure that the system can gracefully handle disruptions.

Netflix emphasizes monitoring and observability to gain insights into system health and performance.
Automated alerts and dashboards provide real-time visibility into the status of applications and infrastructure, enabling rapid response to incidents.
