1. Blue/Green Deployments

Blue/Green deployments involve running two identical production environments, termed "blue" and "green". 
At any time, only one environment (e.g., blue) serves live traffic, while the other (green) remains idle or is used for staging the next release. 
When a new version of the application is ready, it is deployed to the idle environment (green). 
Once verified, the traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment.

Blue/Green deployments are optimal for critical applications where downtime must be minimized and quick rollback capabilities are essential.

2. Canary Deployments
Canary deployments introduce new features to a small subset of users before rolling them out to the entire user base. 
This strategy involves gradually shifting traffic from the old version to the new version, monitoring performance and user feedback at each stage.

Canary deployments are ideal for consumer-facing applications where user feedback and performance metrics are crucial for success. 

3. Rolling deployments

Rolling deployments update instances of an application incrementally across the environment. 
Instead of updating all instances simultaneously, the deployment process updates a few instances at a time, ensuring that some instances are always available to handle requests.

Rolling deployments are suitable for microservices-based architectures and cloud-native applications where maintaining continuous availability is critical, and resource efficiency is a priority.
